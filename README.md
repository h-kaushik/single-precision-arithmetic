# Single Precision Arithmetic for Complex Numbers
This repisitory contains Verilog description for IEEE-754 single precision arithmetic addition and multiplication operations on complex numbers.
The addition operation takes 1 clock cycle to give the results. The multiplication operation, however, has 4-stage pipelined structure.
